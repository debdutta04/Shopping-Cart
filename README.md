Getting Started with Your React Project
This project was initiated with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Starts the application in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
For more information on running tests, refer to the section about running tests.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is now ready to be deployed!

For more information on deployment, refer to the section about deployment.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can customize them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you should not feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
